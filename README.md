Ooo
Ooo-oh
Ya
Whatcha thinking
You think that you could be better off
with somebody new
No-ho-ho baby no
You say you're leaving
Well if you want to leave
there ain't nobody stopping you
No-ho-ho baby no
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please
I won't fall to the ground
On my knees
You know I've given this
Everything baby
Honestly
Baby honestly
I lie for you baby
Die for you baby
Cry for you baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
But tell me what you've done for me
I never cheated
Deleted everyone
cause they made you uncomfortable
No-ho-ho baby no
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
No-ho-ho baby no
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please
(No I won't say please)
I won't fall to the ground
On my knees
(On my knees)
You know I've given this
Everything baby
Honestly
(Baby honestly)
Baby honestly
(Wooo)
I lie for you baby
Die for you baby
Cry for you baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
But tell me what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
Oh tell me what you've done for me
Oh tell me what you've done for me
Ya tell me what you've done for me
You know I've given this
Everything baby
Honestly
Baby honestly
I lie for you baby
Die for you baby
Cry for you baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
But tell me what you've done for me
I lie for you baby
Die for you baby
Cry for you baby
(But tell me)
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
(But tell me)
But tell me what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
Oh tell me what you've done for me
Oh tell me what you've done for me
Ya tell me what you've done for me
