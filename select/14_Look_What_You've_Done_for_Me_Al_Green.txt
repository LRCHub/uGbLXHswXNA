Yeah

Now that you're here with me
I want to keep you free
To do the things that you want to do
The joy in life is loving you
But now the day has come
To let you know where I'm coming from, yeah

The best of my years will go to you
It's the only thing that I can do
But these things don't come overnight
Lovin' you baby, and I think I'm right
Let me say before I forget
Lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, yeah

Ya baby, look what you done for me
Ya baby, you set my heart free
Oh, but I feel, ya
I feel, ya

Sometimes I wanna leave, but then I say
It wouldn't make sense at all anyway
Forgive me baby, if I do wrong
I haven't been a true man for so long
Let be say before I forget
Lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, yeah

Ya baby, look what you done for me
Ya baby, you set my heart free, hey

Baby, do you wanna, do the thing that you oughta
You've been very good for me
And that's a fact, I say

Ya baby, look what you done for me
Ya ya, you set my heart free
Oh, no matter, baby what you done for me
I got the feelin' that it's gonna, yeah

Ya, look what you done for me
Ya baby baby, you set my heart free
