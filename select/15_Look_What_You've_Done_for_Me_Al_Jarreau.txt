Now that you're here with me
I want to keep you free
To do the things that you wanna do
The joy now is loving you
But now the day has come
To let you know where I am coming from
The best of my years to go to you
Is the only thing that I can do
But these things don't come over night
Loving you baby and I think I'm right
Let me say before I forget
That loving you baby is where it's at
Oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free
Sometimes I wanna leave and then I'll say
It wouldn't make sense now anyway
But forgive me baby if I do wrong
I haven't been a true man for so long
Let me say before
I forget loving you baby is where it's at
Oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free
